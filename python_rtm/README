Python - Remember the Milk
--------------------------

Look! A bit of code with no comments...

This module makes it easy to connect to the Remember the Milk API from a
Python program.

You'll need to get your API key and shared secret from Remember the milk.

  >>> api_key = 'eec4eb91abd9160dbbadea07b1722950'
  >>> shared_secret = 'b6b127916a4dacde'

Initially, you'll want to get a new token.

  >>> rtmc = RTMClient(api_key, shared_secret)
  >>> print rtmc.auth_url
  http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/auth/?perms=delete&frob=740a3c1aaff2a9...

Hang on to your RTMClient, and go to the authorisation URL with a
browser, to grant access to the program. Now, you can get the token,
which you can save for use later on.

  >>> token = rtmc.token

When you have a token, you can get new clients without having to
authorise them again.

  >>> rtmc = RTMClient(api_key, shared_secret, token)

Now you can use the client to call the RTM API methods.

  >>> tasks_data = rtm.tasks.rtm.tasks.getList()

The returned JSON is converted into magic structure that you can access
using dot-notation.

  >>> task_id = tasks_data.tasks.list[0]
